My name is Bader - how you pronounce it (batter, bayder, butter), I donâ€™t care all too much. Iâ€™ve heard it all at this point ðŸ˜’.

Iâ€™m a full-stack web3 architect and developer, with a side of tech writing whenever I can fit it in. I write about web3, blockchain use cases, and general projections of what I think society is going to / is becoming

Iâ€™ve been involved with, and may have founded my own startups since I was in high school - all centered around blockchain or DLT. I also am an avid cat lover, coffee enthusiast, and bedroom musician. In fact, next to tech - music is probably my biggest passion.
