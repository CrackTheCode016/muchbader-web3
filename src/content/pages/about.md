My name is Bader - how you pronounce it (batter, bayder, butter), I donâ€™t care all too much. Iâ€™ve heard it all at this point ðŸ˜’.

Iâ€™m a full-stack web3 architect and developer, with a side of tech writing whenever I can fit it in. I write about web3, blockchain use cases, and general projections of what I think society is going to / is becoming

Iâ€™ve been involved with, and may have founded my own startups since I was in high school - all centered around blockchain or DLT. I also am an avid cat lover, coffee enthusiast, and bedroom musician. In fact, next to tech - music is probably my biggest passion.\

I've has previously built over systems on both Ethereum and the NEM/Symbol blockchain - part of which you may see on his Github. I've mainly has focused on creating front-end applications and architecture around purely DLT architectures for multiple companies. I've is proficient in a number of programming languages and protocols, as well as general solution architecture for both low and higher level software.

Some notable projects include:

1. A PoC IoT device that logged sensor data directly to a blockchain. This included a custom UART serial protocol to convert Arduino code to blockchain transactions.
2. Portable battery powered nodes, utilizing a Raspberry Pi. (I'd like to do this for Substrate as well!)
3. The nftize project, an app that allowed for anyone to convert a physical asset to a digital one with ease.
4. Implementing Shamir secret sharing for an "offline multi sig" and private key sharding model.
5. A supply chain tracking system in which crop from the US was tracked to Japan over a private NEM blockchain instance.

In spare time, I've also wrote many articles centered around using blockchain in practical and real world scenarios, which you may find here:Â <https://iodlt.com/iodlt-blog/>

I'm also published on Hackernoon, with articles gaining some traction (plans to write more!):Â <https://hackernoon.com/u/crackTheCode>
