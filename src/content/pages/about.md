My name is Bader - how you pronounce it (batter, bayder, butter), I don’t care all too much. I’ve heard it all at this point 😒.





I’m a full-stack web3 architect and developer, with a side of tech writing whenever I can fit it in. I write about web3, blockchain use cases, and general projections of what I think society is going to / is becoming

I’ve been involved with, and have founded my own startups since I was in high school - all centered around blockchain or DLT. I also am an avid cat lover, coffee enthusiast, and bedroom musician. In fact, next to tech - music is probably my biggest passion.


I started this blog / website to teach people about web3, and most notably how and where to start learning.

I usually cover extensive use cases with how blockchain or web3 tech can improve existing solutions - or make entirely new ones. For example an edge learning, hivemind of package delivery drones that uses a ledger to settle all interactions.

I hope you enjoy this project, and hopefully it turns into something meaningful :)
